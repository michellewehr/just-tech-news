//In the sync method, there is a configuration parameter { force: false }. If we change the value of the force property to true, then the database connection must sync with the model definitions and associations. By forcing the sync method to true, we will make the tables re-create if there are any association changes.

//we use the sequelize.sync() method to establish the connection to the database. The "sync" part means that this is Sequelize taking the models and connecting them to associated database tables. If it doesn't find a table, it'll create it for you!
//The other thing to notice is the use of {force: false} in the .sync() method. This doesn't have to be included, but if it were set to true, it would drop and re-create all of the database tables on startup.
