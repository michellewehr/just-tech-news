// Much like the API folder's index.js file that collects the endpoints and prefixes them, here we are collecting the packaged group of API endpoints and prefixing them with the path /api. Also, note that second use of router.use(). This is so if we make a request to any endpoint that doesn't exist, we'll receive a 404 error indicating we have requested an incorrect resource, another RESTful API practice.
// Now when we import the routes to server.js, they'll already be packaged and ready to go with this one file! Let's get server.js set up now.
const router = require('express').Router();

const apiRoutes = require('./api');

router.use('/api', apiRoutes);

router.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).end();
});

module.exports = router;
